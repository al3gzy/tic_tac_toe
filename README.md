# Tic-Tac-Toe Game with AI

## Overview

This project implements a **Tic-Tac-Toe** game where a human player competes against an AI opponent using the **minimax algorithm**. The AI makes optimal moves to maximize its chances of winning, offering a competitive yet simple game experience. The gameâ€™s design showcases the application of strategic decision-making in a small, interactive environment.

## Key Concepts

### Minimax Algorithm
A decision-making algorithm used in two-player games to minimize the possible loss for a worst-case scenario. The AI player maximizes its chances of winning by evaluating all possible moves.

### Game Tree
The structure used by the minimax algorithm to explore all possible moves and their outcomes.

### Game Over Conditions
The game ends when one player wins, or all cells are filled, resulting in a draw.

## Objectives

1. Implement a strategic game where the player competes against an AI.
2. Use the minimax algorithm for the AI to make optimal decisions.
3. Explore how recursive game trees can evaluate the best possible moves in a competitive environment.

## Features

- **Interactive Play**: Players input their moves and the AI responds by making the best possible move.
- **Minimax AI**: The AI opponent uses the minimax algorithm to predict and make the best possible move.
- **Game Over Detection**: Automatically checks for a winner or draw.
